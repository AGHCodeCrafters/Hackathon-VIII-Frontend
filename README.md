# Project description ðŸ“œ
Optima is a tool that allows you to effectively manage the work of warehouses and increase the efficiency of employees.
<br><br>
It offers a number of functionalities, such as optimal management of employees' working time, selection of the shortest route to perform tasks and presentation of the warehouse in the form of a map. The employee has the ability to see only the currently performed task, which increases its effectiveness.
<br><br>
The program also evaluates the time efficiency of employees and rewards them with points for good performance, which can be exchanged for rewards selected by the employer.

### Optima is an app that was developed during Hackathon - the "Best Hacking League". The ideation, design, and development processes were completed within 24 hours, which resulted in code that may not be as clean as it should be, and potentially some part of it might be suboptimal :blush:
